# Capital-Bikeshare
This project is a submission to Blue Yonder for Data Science Consultant position. 

The project is trying to answer the question of “How natural factors affect using rental bike service for Capital Bikeshare System in Washington DC?” by analyzing the [Capital Bikeshare Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). hour.csv file has been processed for the hourly utilization of total number of rental bikes.

A clean version of Python code is created for the analysis of the data set along with some Test Driven Development.  However, Jupyter Notebook is used for data analysis to create a chronological explanation of the implementation.
